# PT2 Project : Developing a Game Using OOP Concepts and Graphics Library

## Rhythm Reflex

The game is a circular timing reaction challenge where the player must press the SPACE key when a rotating pointer enters a highlighted zone. As the game progresses, 
the pointer speed increases, making the game more challenging. The player earns points for accurate timing. The round lasts for a fixed time, and the final score will reflect the player’s performance.
