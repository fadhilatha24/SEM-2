# Assignment 4 : Biocon Industrial Visit
DATE : 20 November 2025

Venue : Biocon Sdn. Bhd. in Gelang Patah, Johor

## Reflection
This visit provided me with valuable insights into how pharmaceutical products are developed and optimized before large-scale manufacturing. 
Observing small-scale experimentation, data generation, and process optimization helped me understand the importance of research, validation, 
continuous improvement in biotechnology, and also the role of IT in this industry. This visit also gave me insights on how data, quality standards, 
and collaboration between R&D and production teams contribute to producing safe and effective pharmaceutical products.
