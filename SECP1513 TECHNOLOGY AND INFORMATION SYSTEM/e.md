# Design Thinking Project : HelloBuddies


## Reflection
From this design thinking project, I gained knowledge regarding the importance of understanding user needs before developing any digital solution. 
Through the design thinking process, I learned how empathy, problem definition, and ideation contribute to creating a meaningful and user-centred design. 
I plan to further improve my potential in the industry by strengthening my skills in prototyping tools and continuously refining my understanding of the 
design thinking process, as these skills will be frequently applied in future courses and professional practice.
