# Assignment 1 : UTMDigital Open Day Video
DATE : 29 October 2025

## Reflection
Attending this event gave me valuable insight into the digital operations and working environment within a university setting. 
Through interactions with industry partners, the project management talk, and the interview with the HR representative, 
I gained a better understanding of how digital services are managed, the importance of effective project coordination, and the professional culture at UTMDigital. 
The experience helped broaden my perspective on career opportunities in IT and strengthened my interest in working in a structured digital services environment.
