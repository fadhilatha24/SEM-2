# Assignment 3 : Industry Talk 2 and Academic Writing
DATE : 18 December 2025

## Reflection
From the industry talk, I realized that succeeding in the computer science field requires more than just technical skills. 
Strong project management, clear communication, teamwork, and a good understanding of system development processes are also essential. 
The talk helped me understand the importance of applying methods such as Waterfall and using AI tools wisely without over-relying on them. 
In the future, I plan to strengthen my fundamentals in system design and project management through group projects and coursework to better 
prepare myself for real-world industry challenges.
